## Objects ##

### Definition ###
- An object is a data structure that can store state and behavior
  - State: Data (properties with values that are not functions i.e primitives, arrays, simple objects etc.)
  - Behavior: Operations (properties with values that are functions
    - These are called *methods*
  
```javascript
let obj = {
  num: 1, // state
  
  speak() {
    console.log('hey'); // behavior
  }
}

```
## Methods ##

### Definition ###
- Properties of an object that have *functions* as values

### Other facts ###
- Methods can be referred to as an objects *behvarior*
- Methods can be invoked using dot-notation

```javascript
// Using obj object from above
obj.speak(); // example of dot notation
```

## Encapsulation ##
- Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and the operations that work on that data together in a single entity (i.e an object)
  - Packaging related state and behavior together
  - **Note** In other languages, encapsulation also refers to the seperation of public and private data, but this is not supported in JS
    - In these cases, an object exposes specific state and operations (referd to as the public interface) for other objects, while keeping other state and behavior inaccessible to other objects

```javascript
// encapsulating data and operations for this student into a single object
let student = {
  name: 'Brandon',
  year: 12,
  grades: [91, 87, 93],
  
  getGPA() {
    let gradesEntered = this.grades.length;
    let total = this.grades.reduce((sum, grade) => sum + grade);
    
    return total / gradesEntered;
  }
}
```
